This will be the front end webapp for the Node Security Project at nodesecurity.io. 

## Phase I
- Convert site to hapi 2.0
- Add form for reporting module vulnerability (emails via postmark)
- Publish advisories via markdown files + meta data (already done on liftsecurity site, just port the code) - At least we can publish advisories then. It's not perfect but will work for now.
